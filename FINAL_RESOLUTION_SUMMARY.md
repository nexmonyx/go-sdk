# Final Resolution - Authentication and Endpoint Issues

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Endpoint Paths in SDK**
   - SDK was calling `/v1/servers/heartbeat` but API expects `/v1/heartbeat`
   - SDK was calling `/v1/servers/{uuid}/details` but API expects `/v1/server/{uuid}/details` (singular)
   - These endpoints were returning 500 "Unhandled route" errors

2. **Inconsistent Authentication Headers in API**
   - Different endpoints expect different header formats:
     - `/v1/heartbeat` - Works with `X-Server-UUID` headers
     - `/v1/server/{uuid}/details` - Works with `Server-UUID` headers (no X-)
     - `/v2/metrics/comprehensive` - Works with `X-Server-UUID` headers
   - This inconsistency needs to be addressed on the API side

## SDK Fixes Applied (v1.1.3)

### 1. Fixed Endpoint Paths
```go
// Heartbeat - Changed from /v1/servers/heartbeat to /v1/heartbeat
Path: "/v1/heartbeat"

// UpdateDetails - Changed from /v1/servers/{uuid}/details to /v1/server/{uuid}/details  
Path: fmt.Sprintf("/v1/server/%s/details", serverUUID)
```

### 2. Authentication Headers
- SDK currently uses `X-Server-UUID` and `X-Server-Secret`
- This works for most endpoints (heartbeat, v2 metrics)
- Server details update may fail until API is made consistent

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- **Heartbeat**: `POST /v1/heartbeat` - Working with X- headers
- **Metrics v2**: `POST /v2/metrics/comprehensive` - Working with X- headers

### Partially Working ⚠️
- **Server Details Update**: `PUT /v1/server/{uuid}/details` - Expects non-X headers (inconsistent with others)

### Not Tested Yet
- **Hardware Inventory**: `POST /v2/hardware/inventory`
- **Metrics v1**: `POST /v1/metrics/comprehensive`

## API Issues to Address

1. **Authentication Consistency**
   - All endpoints should accept the same header format
   - Recommend accepting both formats for compatibility:
     ```python
     server_uuid = headers.get('X-Server-UUID') or headers.get('Server-UUID')
     server_secret = headers.get('X-Server-Secret') or headers.get('Server-Secret')
     ```

2. **Endpoint Documentation**
   - Document the correct endpoint paths
   - The SDK had wrong paths because they seemed logical (`/v1/servers/...`)

## Testing Results

```bash
# Heartbeat - WORKS with X- headers
curl -X POST "https://api-dev.nexmonyx.com/v1/heartbeat" \
  -H "X-Server-UUID: 182193a4-0e57-4f14-9d21-a8d41f860e38" \
  -H "X-Server-Secret: ..." 
# Response: 200 OK

# Server Details - WORKS with non-X headers  
curl -X PUT "https://api-dev.nexmonyx.com/v1/server/182193a4-0e57-4f14-9d21-a8d41f860e38/details" \
  -H "Server-UUID: 182193a4-0e57-4f14-9d21-a8d41f860e38" \
  -H "Server-Secret: ..."
# Response: 200 OK

# V2 Metrics - WORKS with X- headers
curl -X POST "https://api-dev.nexmonyx.com/v2/metrics/comprehensive" \
  -H "X-Server-UUID: 182193a4-0e57-4f14-9d21-a8d41f860e38" \
  -H "X-Server-Secret: ..."
# Response: 200 OK
```

## Next Steps

1. **Release SDK v1.1.3** with the endpoint path fixes
2. **API Team** should standardize authentication headers across all endpoints
3. **Document** the correct endpoint paths and authentication requirements
4. **Test** all agent operations end-to-end

## For Agent Team

- SDK v1.1.3 fixes the critical endpoint path issues
- Heartbeat and v2 metrics will work correctly
- Server details update may require API-side fix for consistent authentication
