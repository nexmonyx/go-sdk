# Current Status - Authentication Issues

## As of 2025-07-08 15:35 UTC

### What's Working ✅
- **v2/metrics/comprehensive** - Works with `X-Server-UUID` and `X-Server-Secret` headers
- SDK v1.1.3 has been updated to send X- prefixed headers

### What's NOT Working ❌
- **v1/servers/heartbeat** - Returns 500 error with both header formats
- **v1/servers/{uuid}/details** - Returns 500 error with both header formats  
- **v1/metrics/comprehensive** - Returns 500 error with both header formats
- **v2/hardware/inventory** - Returns 500 error with both header formats

### SDK Status
- **v1.1.3** (not yet released) - Reverted to use X- prefix headers
- **v1.1.2** (current release) - Uses non-prefixed headers (doesn't work with current API)

### Key Finding
The API authentication handling appears to have changed:
- Initially, v2 required non-prefixed headers
- Now, v2 requires X-prefixed headers
- v1 endpoints are completely broken (500 errors)

### Next Steps
1. API team needs to investigate why v1 endpoints are returning 500 errors
2. API team needs to clarify the correct header format going forward
3. Once v1 endpoints are fixed, we can release SDK v1.1.3

### For Agent Team
**DO NOT upgrade to SDK v1.1.2** - it won't work with the current API state.
Wait for further updates once the v1 endpoint issues are resolved.
