  - Fixed `/v2/servers/` to `/v2/server/` in `metrics.go` and `network_hardware.go`
  - Changed `/v1/metrics/servers/` to `/v1/metrics/server/` in `metrics.go`
  - Updated `auth_debug.go` heartbeat endpoint to use `/v1/server/heartbeat`
  - This aligns with the API specification that requires singular form for all server endpoints

  - `DiskTotalGB` → `StorageTotal`
  - `UUID` → `ServerUUID`

## [1.1.6] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed
- **SendHeartbeat Method**: Fixed incorrect endpoint path
  - Changed from `/v1/servers/{uuid}/heartbeat` to `/v1/server/{uuid}/heartbeat`

### Added
- **Comprehensive Debug Logging**: Added extensive debug logging for all heartbeat and server info operations
  - Heartbeat methods now show endpoint, authentication details, request/response status

  - Changed heartbeat endpoint from `/v1/servers/heartbeat` to `/v1/heartbeat`
  - Changed server details endpoint from `/v1/servers/{uuid}/details` to `/v1/server/{uuid}/details`
  - These were causing "Unhandled route" errors on the API side
- **Authentication Headers**: Reverted to X- prefix headers as API behavior is inconsistent
  - Different endpoints expect different header formats
  - SDK now uses `X-Server-UUID` and `X-Server-Secret` to match most endpoints

### Added
- **New Server Methods**: Added methods for all server-related endpoints
  - `UpdateInfo()` - Updates server info at `/v1/server/{uuid}/info`
  - `GetDetails()` - Retrieves server details from `/v1/server/{uuid}/details`
