# Coverage threshold configuration for go-sdk
#
# This file defines the minimum test coverage requirements for the project.
# The CI/CD pipeline enforces these thresholds to prevent coverage regression.

[thresholds]
# Overall project coverage requirement
overall_minimum = 80.0

# Per-package coverage requirement (default for all packages)
package_minimum = 70.0

# Critical packages require higher coverage
critical_packages = client.go,errors.go,models.go,response.go
critical_minimum = 90.0

# Packages exempt from coverage requirements (with justification)
# Format: package_path = reason
[exemptions]
examples/ = "Example code, not production"
# testutil/ = "Test helpers, tested implicitly"

[pr_requirements]
# Minimum coverage for new/changed code in pull requests
new_code_minimum = 85.0

# Whether to fail PR if new code doesn't meet threshold
fail_on_new_code = true

# Whether to fail PR if overall coverage decreases

[reporting]
# Generate detailed per-file coverage report

# Show only files below threshold in reports
