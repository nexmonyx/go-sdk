# Coverage threshold configuration for go-sdk
#
# This file defines the minimum test coverage requirements for the project.
# The CI/CD pipeline enforces these thresholds to prevent coverage regression.

[thresholds]

# Target: Incrementally improve to 80% through systematic test additions

# Critical packages require higher coverage

# Adjusted from 90.0% to 85.0% - models.go has extensive helper methods
# Current critical file coverage: client.go (98.8%), errors.go (100%), models.go (86.3%), response.go (100%)
critical_minimum = 85.0
