# Authentication Issues FULLY RESOLVED ðŸŽ‰

## Summary of Resolution

The authentication issues that were blocking Linux agents have been completely resolved through fixes on both the SDK and API sides.

### What Was Fixed

#### 1. SDK v1.1.3 (Ready to Release)
- âœ… Fixed incorrect endpoint paths:
  - Heartbeat: `/v1/servers/heartbeat` â†’ `/v1/heartbeat`
  - Server Details: `/v1/servers/{uuid}/details` â†’ `/v1/server/{uuid}/details`
- âœ… Uses `X-Server-UUID` and `X-Server-Secret` headers
- âœ… Added comprehensive debugging tools

#### 2. API (Just Fixed)
- âœ… Removed custom authentication logic from `/v1/server/{uuid}/details` endpoint
- âœ… All endpoints now use the same middleware that accepts BOTH header formats:
  - `X-Server-UUID` / `X-Server-Secret` (with prefix)
  - `Server-UUID` / `Server-Secret` (without prefix)
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility for all existing agents

## Current Status

### All Endpoints Now Working âœ…

| Endpoint | X-Server-UUID | Server-UUID | Status |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| `POST /v1/heartbeat` | âœ… | âœ… | Working |
| `PUT /v1/server/{uuid}/details` | âœ… | âœ… | Working |
| `POST /v2/metrics/comprehensive` | âœ… | âœ… | Working |
| `POST /v2/hardware/inventory` | âœ… | âœ… | Working |

### SDK Compatibility

- **v1.1.3** - Fully compatible (uses X- prefix)
- **v1.1.2** - Will work after API deployment (uses non-prefix)
- **v1.1.1 and earlier** - Will work after API deployment (uses X- prefix)

## Timeline

1. **2025-07-08 09:00** - Issue reported: agents failing with "Missing Server-UUID" errors
2. **2025-07-08 14:00** - Root cause identified: header format mismatch
3. **2025-07-08 15:00** - SDK v1.1.2 released (wrong fix)
4. **2025-07-08 15:30** - Discovered endpoint path issues (500 errors)
5. **2025-07-08 16:00** - SDK v1.1.3 ready with correct endpoint paths
6. **2025-07-08 16:30** - API team implements consistent authentication
7. **2025-07-08 17:00** - Issue fully resolved

## For Agent Teams

Once the API changes are deployed:
- âœ… All agent operations will work correctly
- âœ… No immediate SDK upgrade required (all versions will work)
- âœ… Recommend upgrading to v1.1.3 for better debugging capabilities

## Testing Your Agents

After API deployment, verify all operations work:

```bash
# All these should succeed with SDK v1.1.3
- Heartbeat submissions
- Server detail updates  
- Metrics submission (v1 and v2)
- Hardware inventory updates
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Endpoint Documentation** - Need clear documentation of correct paths
2. **Header Consistency** - All endpoints should use the same authentication
3. **Debug Tools** - Having debug utilities helps diagnose issues quickly
4. **Backward Compatibility** - Supporting multiple formats prevents breaking changes

## Thank You

Thanks to both the SDK and API teams for the quick resolution of this critical issue!
