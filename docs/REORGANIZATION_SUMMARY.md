# Repository Reorganization Summary

## What Was Changed

The Nexmonyx Go SDK repository has been completely reorganized from a flat structure with 48+ Go files in the root directory to a clean, logical structure following Go best practices.

## New Structure

```
nexmonyx-go-sdk/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md, go.mod, go.sum, CLAUDE.md (essential files in root)
â”œâ”€â”€ nexmonyx.go                    # Backwards compatibility re-exports
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/nexmonyx/                  # Main SDK package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.go                  # Core client

## Backwards Compatibility

**âœ… No Breaking Changes!** The main `nexmonyx.go` file in the root re-exports all types and functions from the new structure, so existing code will continue to work without modification.

### Before (still works):
```go
import "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2"

client, err := nexmonyx.NewClient(&nexmonyx.Config{...})
```

### After (new internal structure):
```go
// Still works exactly the same!
import "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2"

client, err := nexmonyx.NewClient(&nexmonyx.Config{...})
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ðŸŽ¯ **Improved Navigation**
- Logical grouping by functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to find specific services or models

### ðŸ§¹ **Cleaner Root Directory**
- From 48+ Go files down to 1 compatibility file
- Only essential project files visible
- Professional project appearance

### ðŸ”§ **Better Maintainability**
- Services organized in dedicated directory
- Hardware-specific code separated
- Models consolidated logically
- Tests organized by type

### ðŸ§ª **Organized Testing**
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Examples in dedicated `examples/` directory

### ðŸ“š **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Standard Go project layout
- Clear module boundaries
- Easier to contribute and understand

## Migration Path (Optional)

While not required, developers can optionally migrate to the new internal structure for cleaner imports:

```go
// Old way (still works)
import "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2"

// New way (optional, cleaner)
import (
    "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2/pkg/nexmonyx"
    "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2/pkg/nexmonyx/services"
    "github.com/nexmonyx/go-sdk/v2/pkg/nexmonyx/models"
)
```

## Files Moved

### Core Files
- `client.go` â†’ `pkg/nexmonyx/client.go`
- `errors.go` â†’ `pkg/nexmonyx/errors.go`
- `models.go` â†’ `pkg/nexmonyx/models/models.go`

### Services (27 files moved to `pkg/nexmonyx/services/`)
- All service implementation files organized by domain
- Billing, monitoring, alerts, admin, etc.

### Hardware Services (3 files moved to `pkg/nexmonyx/hardware/`)
- `hardware_inventory.go` â†’ `inventory.go`
- `ipmi.go` â†’ `ipmi.go`
- `systemd.go` â†’ `systemd.go`

### Tests (11 files moved to `tests/unit/`)
- All `*_test.go` files organized
- Integration test moved to `tests/integration/`

### Examples (2 files moved to `examples/basic/`)
- Example code organized for reference

## Development Impact

- **Build commands**: Unchanged
- **Test commands**: Unchanged  
- **Import paths**: Unchanged (backwards compatible)
- **CI/CD**: Unchanged
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect new structure

## Next Steps

1. Update internal imports to use new structure (optional)
2. Add domain-specific documentation in `docs/`
3. Consider splitting large model files by domain
4. Add more examples in the `examples/` directory

This reorganization provides a solid foundation for future growth while maintaining complete backwards compatibility.
