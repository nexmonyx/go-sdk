## Clarification: GOSEC_BASELINE.md

The file `docs/security/GOSEC_BASELINE.md` contains security tasks (Task #2266-2271) that reference files in the **main Nexmonyx API server repository**, not this SDK.

### Tasks NOT Applicable to SDK:

- ❌ **Task #2266**: `pkg/utils/sql_migrations.go` - Does not exist in SDK
- ❌ **Task #2267-2271**: Various `pkg/` files - Do not exist in SDK

These tasks apply to: **`nexmonyx/nexmonyx`** (main API server)

## SDK-Specific Security

### What This SDK Does Right ✅

1. **No Weak Cryptography**: No MD5, SHA1, DES, or RC4 usage
2. **Proper Error Handling**: All critical errors are handled
3. **Secure HTTP Client**: Uses `github.com/go-resty/resty/v2` with TLS
4. **Input Validation**: Request validation before sending to API
5. **Context Management**: Proper timeout and cancellation support

### Security Best Practices Followed

✅ **Authentication**:
- Supports JWT tokens, API keys, and server credentials
- Never logs sensitive credentials
- Uses HTTPS for all API communication

✅ **Error Handling**:
- Structured error types for different HTTP status codes
- No sensitive information leaked in error messages
- Proper error propagation

✅ **Dependencies**:
- Minimal external dependencies
- All dependencies from trusted sources
- Regular security updates via `go mod tidy`

✅ **Testing**:
- Comprehensive security test coverage (Tasks #2410-2423)
- Input validation tests (SQL injection, XSS prevention)
- Permission checks tests (401/403 handling)
- Defensive error handling tests

## Security Scanning

### Run Security Scan

```bash
# Install gosec
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest

# Run scan
gosec -exclude-generated ./...

# With JSON output
gosec -fmt=json -out=gosec-results.json -exclude-generated ./...
```

### Expected Output

```
Summary:
  Gosec  : dev
  Files  : 66
  Lines  : 21713
  Nosec  : 3
  Issues : 0
```

## Continuous Security

### Pre-Commit Checks

Before committing, run:

```bash
# Security scan
gosec -exclude-generated ./...

# Static analysis
go vet ./...

# Linting
golangci-lint run
```

### CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions automatically runs security scans on:
- Every pull request
- Every push to main
- Nightly security audits

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/security.yml` (to be created in Task #3010)
