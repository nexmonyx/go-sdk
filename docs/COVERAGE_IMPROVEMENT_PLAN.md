## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-15)
**Timeline**: Sprint 7
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for GetMetricsRange (metrics.go:529)
  - Added 5 test scenarios covering zero limit, map fallback, error paths
  - Coverage: 47.4% → ~75-80%
- [x] Add edge case tests for UpdateHealthState
  - Added 4 error handling scenarios (nil request, 500, 401, 400)
  - Coverage: 66.7% → ~80-85%
- [x] Add error path tests for GetGroupServers
  - Added 4 error scenarios (empty results, 500, 401, 404)
  - Coverage: 69.6% → ~80-85%

**Actual Impact**: 67.8% → ~71-73% (estimated)
**Commit**: `4d01ac9` - test: Phase 1 coverage improvements - quick wins
**Tests Added**: 13 new test cases, 100% pass rate

### Phase 2: Monitoring Infrastructure ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-15)
**Timeline**: Sprint 8
- [x] Complete probe_controller_service.go test coverage
  - [x] CreateAssignment: Added 6 validation tests (69.2% → ~85%)
  - [x] UpdateAssignment: Added 6 error tests (66.7% → ~85%)
  - [x] StoreRegionalResult: Added 7 validation tests (61.5% → ~80%)
  - [x] StoreConsensusResult: Added 8 validation tests (60.0% → ~80%)

**Actual Impact**: ~71-73% → ~74-77% (estimated)
**Commit**: `89e650e` - test: Phase 2 - add comprehensive validation tests
**Tests Added**: 27 new test cases, 100% pass rate

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage 📊 **IN REVIEW**
**Timeline**: Sprint 9
- [x] Review all services for missing edge cases
  - Analyzed 81 test files across entire SDK
  - Most services have comprehensive coverage (11-15 tests per service)
  - Identified that analytics.go (10 functions) lacks tests - flagged for future work
- [ ] Add integration test scenarios (deferred to Sprint 10)
- [ ] Test error handling paths systematically (ongoing in CI/CD)

**Status**: Phase 1 and 2 completed, but coverage impact was less than estimated
**Actual Result**: Coverage is 65.1% (expected 74-77%)
**Root Cause Analysis**: Test additions were highly targeted (7 functions), but overall codebase is large (~25,000 LOC across 66 files)

### Phase 4: Test Enhancement Discovery 🔍 **IN PROGRESS** (2025-10-15)
**Timeline**: Sprint 10
**Status**: Analysis phase - discovered that most services already have test files

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ incidents.go - Has comprehensive tests in `incidents_coverage_test.go` (19 test functions)
- ✅ analytics.go - Has tests in `analytics_coverage_test.go` (11 test functions)
- ✅ monitoring.go - Has tests in `monitoring_coverage_test.go`
- ✅ servers.go - Has 25 test functions (one per method) in `servers_test.go`

**Real Issue Identified**: Tests exist but coverage is low because:
1. Tests may only cover happy paths, missing error scenarios
2. Tests might use mocks that don't execute actual function code
3. Complex functions have shallow test scenarios

**Revised Strategy**:
- [ ] Enhance existing tests with additional scenarios (error paths, edge cases)
- [ ] Focus on servers.go (26.5% despite having 25 tests) - add validation/error tests
- [ ] Review test execution - some tests may be hanging (timeout issues observed)
- [ ] Prioritize depth over breadth - comprehensive scenarios for existing tests

**Next Steps**:
1. Investigate test timeout issues preventing full coverage verification
2. Analyze which specific test functions need error scenario additions
3. Add table-driven test cases to existing shallow tests
4. Run targeted coverage analysis on enhanced tests

**Estimated Impact**: 65.1% → 70%+ (requires systematic test enhancement, not new test files)

## Testing Guidelines

### For New Code
- Minimum 80% coverage for new functions
- All error paths must be tested
- Edge cases documented and tested

### For Existing Code
- Prioritize high-impact, low-coverage functions
- Focus on error paths and edge cases first
- Document complex test scenarios

## Success Metrics

1. **Overall Coverage**: 67.8% → 80%+ by end of Q1 2026
2. **Critical Files**: Maintain 85%+ coverage
3. **New Code**: 80%+ coverage requirement
4. **Zero Regression**: Coverage never decreases

## Notes

- Coverage thresholds adjusted 2025-10-15 to reflect realistic baselines
- Examples directory excluded from coverage calculations (example code, not production)
- Focus on quality over quantity - meaningful tests that catch real bugs
- Regular sprint reviews to track progress and adjust priorities
