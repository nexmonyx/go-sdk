## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-10-15)
**Timeline**: Sprint 7
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for GetMetricsRange (metrics.go:529)
  - Added 5 test scenarios covering zero limit, map fallback, error paths
  - Coverage: 47.4% â†’ ~75-80%
- [x] Add edge case tests for UpdateHealthState
  - Added 4 error handling scenarios (nil request, 500, 401, 400)
  - Coverage: 66.7% â†’ ~80-85%
- [x] Add error path tests for GetGroupServers
  - Added 4 error scenarios (empty results, 500, 401, 404)
  - Coverage: 69.6% â†’ ~80-85%

**Actual Impact**: 67.8% â†’ ~71-73% (estimated)
**Commit**: `4d01ac9` - test: Phase 1 coverage improvements - quick wins
**Tests Added**: 13 new test cases, 100% pass rate

### Phase 2: Monitoring Infrastructure âœ… **COMPLETED** (2025-10-15)
**Timeline**: Sprint 8
- [x] Complete probe_controller_service.go test coverage
  - [x] CreateAssignment: Added 6 validation tests (69.2% â†’ ~85%)
  - [x] UpdateAssignment: Added 6 error tests (66.7% â†’ ~85%)
  - [x] StoreRegionalResult: Added 7 validation tests (61.5% â†’ ~80%)
  - [x] StoreConsensusResult: Added 8 validation tests (60.0% â†’ ~80%)

**Actual Impact**: ~71-73% â†’ ~74-77% (estimated)
**Commit**: `89e650e` - test: Phase 2 - add comprehensive validation tests
**Tests Added**: 27 new test cases, 100% pass rate

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage ðŸ“Š **IN REVIEW**
**Timeline**: Sprint 9
- [x] Review all services for missing edge cases
  - Analyzed 81 test files across entire SDK
  - Most services have comprehensive coverage (11-15 tests per service)
  - Identified that analytics.go (10 functions) lacks tests - flagged for future work
- [ ] Add integration test scenarios (deferred to Sprint 10)
- [ ] Test error handling paths systematically (ongoing in CI/CD)

**Status**: Phase 1 and 2 completed, but coverage impact was less than estimated
**Actual Result**: Coverage is 65.1% (expected 74-77%)
**Root Cause Analysis**: Test additions were highly targeted (7 functions), but overall codebase is large (~25,000 LOC across 66 files)

### Phase 4: Baseline Stabilization (Target: +4.9% to reach 70%)
**Timeline**: Sprint 10
- [ ] Add basic tests for untested functions in high-impact services
  - [ ] servers.go: Target 26.5% â†’ 60% (add 10-15 basic tests)
  - [ ] analytics.go: Add 5-8 basic tests for core functions
  - [ ] Review other services with <60% file-level coverage
- [ ] Focus on breadth (many simple tests) vs depth (comprehensive test scenarios)
- [ ] Prioritize critical user-facing services

**Estimated Impact**: 65.1% â†’ 70%+
**Strategy**: Add basic happy-path tests for currently untested functions to raise baseline

## Testing Guidelines

### For New Code
- Minimum 80% coverage for new functions
- All error paths must be tested
- Edge cases documented and tested

### For Existing Code
- Prioritize high-impact, low-coverage functions
- Focus on error paths and edge cases first
- Document complex test scenarios

## Success Metrics

1. **Overall Coverage**: 67.8% â†’ 80%+ by end of Q1 2026
2. **Critical Files**: Maintain 85%+ coverage
3. **New Code**: 80%+ coverage requirement
4. **Zero Regression**: Coverage never decreases

## Notes

- Coverage thresholds adjusted 2025-10-15 to reflect realistic baselines
- Examples directory excluded from coverage calculations (example code, not production)
- Focus on quality over quantity - meaningful tests that catch real bugs
- Regular sprint reviews to track progress and adjust priorities
