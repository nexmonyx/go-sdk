# Coverage Automation Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-17
**Task:** #3012 - Automated Coverage Reporting

---

## Overview

The Nexmonyx Go SDK includes a comprehensive automated coverage reporting system that tracks, monitors, and reports on code coverage metrics. This system consists of multiple integrated tools and workflows.

## Components

### 1. Coverage Audit Script (`scripts/coverage_audit.sh`)

Comprehensive coverage analysis with detailed reporting.

**Features:**
- Runs test suite with coverage measurement
- Calculates service layer coverage statistics
- Validates coverage thresholds
- Generates HTML reports
- Creates detailed audit summaries
- Creates symlinks for easy access to latest reports

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run monthly coverage audit
./scripts/coverage_audit.sh

# Output directory: coverage_reports/
```

**Generated Artifacts:**
- `coverage_TIMESTAMP.out` - Raw coverage data
- `coverage_TIMESTAMP.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `coverage_detailed_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Detailed function coverage
- `test_output_TIMESTAMP.log` - Test execution log
- `audit_summary_TIMESTAMP.md` - Audit summary markdown
- `latest.html` - Symlink to latest HTML report
- `latest_detailed.txt` - Symlink to latest detailed report
- `latest_summary.md` - Symlink to latest audit summary

**Thresholds:**
- Package-wide: â‰¥ 40%
- Service layer: â‰¥ 80%

### 2. Coverage Badge Generator (`scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh`)

Generates SVG badge showing current coverage percentage.

**Features:**
- Creates color-coded SVG badge
- Color scheme based on coverage thresholds:
  - Red: < 40% (poor)
  - Orange: 40-60% (acceptable)
  - Yellow: 60-80% (good)
  - Green: â‰¥ 80% (excellent)
- Generates markdown reference file
- Badge updates with each run

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate badge from coverage file
./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh [coverage_file]

# Default: coverage.out
./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh

# Output directory: .coverage-badges/
```

**Usage in README:**
```markdown
[![Coverage Badge](.coverage-badges/coverage-badge.svg)](coverage_reports/latest.html)
```

**Generated Artifacts:**
- `.coverage-badges/coverage-badge.svg` - SVG badge
- `.coverage-badges/badge.md` - Markdown reference

### 3. Coverage History Tracker (`scripts/track-coverage-history.sh`)

Tracks coverage metrics over time and generates trend reports.

**Features:**
- Appends coverage metrics to CSV history file
- Calculates service layer coverage
- Detects coverage trends (improving/declining/stable)
- Generates trend analysis markdown
- Shows trend visualization

**Usage:**
```bash
# Track coverage history from coverage file
./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh [coverage_file]

# Default: coverage.out
./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh

# Output directory: coverage_reports/
```

**Generated Artifacts:**
- `coverage_history.csv` - CSV with historical data
- `coverage_trends.md` - Trend analysis report

**CSV Format:**
```csv
Date,Total Coverage %,Service Layer %,Commit Hash
2025-10-17,40.3,85.0,4276aa5
```

**Trend Detection:**
- ðŸ“ˆ Improving: Coverage increasing over time
- ðŸ“‰ Declining: Coverage decreasing over time
- ðŸ“Š Stable: No significant change

### 4. Monthly Coverage Audit Workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage-audit.yml`)

Automated workflow that runs monthly coverage audits via GitHub Actions.

**Schedule:**
- Monthly: 2 AM UTC on the 1st of each month
- Trigger: Manual workflow dispatch available

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Run comprehensive coverage audit
2. Generate coverage badge
3. Track coverage history
4. Upload artifacts (90-day retention)
5. Create PR with updated badges/history (automatic)
6. Generate summary report

**Features:**
- Automatic badge generation
- History tracking with trend analysis
- Coverage metrics comparison
- PR creation for badge updates
- Artifact retention for 90 days
- Failure notifications

**Accessing Results:**
- View artifacts: Actions â†’ Coverage Audit workflow â†’ Artifacts
- HTML Report: `coverage_reports/coverage_*.html`
- Trends: `coverage_reports/coverage_trends.md`
- History: `coverage_reports/coverage_history.csv`

---

## Integration

### With CI/CD Pipeline

The existing CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) already includes:
- Test execution with coverage (`-coverprofile=coverage.out`)
- Coverage threshold validation
- HTML report generation
- Codecov integration
- PR comment with coverage summary

**The new coverage automation extends this by:**
- Monthly comprehensive audits
- Long-term trend tracking
- Badge generation and updates
- Automated badge PRs

### Local Usage

**One-time audit:**
```bash
./scripts/coverage_audit.sh
```

**Generate badge:**
```bash
./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh
```

**Track metrics:**
```bash
./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh
```

**Combined workflow:**
```bash
# Run tests
go test -short -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Run audit
./scripts/coverage_audit.sh

# Generate badge
./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh coverage_reports/coverage_*.out

# Track history
./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh coverage_reports/coverage_*.out
```

## Interpreting Results

### Coverage Badges

**Color Meanings:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green (â‰¥80%): Excellent coverage, production-ready
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow (60-80%): Good coverage, acceptable for release
- ðŸŸ  Orange (40-60%): Acceptable coverage, consider improvements
- ðŸ”´ Red (<40%): Poor coverage, needs attention

### Trend Reports

**Trend Indicators:**
- ðŸ“ˆ **Improving**: Coverage increased from baseline
- ðŸ“‰ **Declining**: Coverage decreased from baseline
- ðŸ“Š **Stable**: Coverage unchanged or minimal change

### History CSV

**Reading the CSV:**
```csv
Date,Total Coverage %,Service Layer %,Commit Hash
2025-10-17,40.3,85.0,4276aa5
```

- Date: Audit date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Total Coverage: Package-wide coverage %
- Service Layer: Service API coverage %
- Commit: Git commit hash at time of audit

## Maintenance

### Update Badge

Badge is automatically generated during:
1. Monthly workflow runs
2. Manual badge script execution

To manually update:
```bash
go test -short -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh coverage.out
```

### Track New Metrics

History is automatically updated during:
1. Monthly workflow runs
2. Manual history script execution

To manually track:
```bash
./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh coverage.out
```

### Review Trends

View coverage trends:
```bash
cat coverage_reports/coverage_trends.md
```

View raw history:
```bash
cat coverage_reports/coverage_history.csv
```

## Troubleshooting

### Badge Not Generating

**Issue:** Script fails to generate badge

**Solution:**
1. Verify coverage file exists: `ls coverage.out`
2. Check script is executable: `chmod +x scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh`
3. Run with explicit coverage file: `./scripts/generate-coverage-badge.sh coverage.out`

### History Not Tracking

**Issue:** History file empty or not updating

**Solution:**
1. Verify coverage file exists
2. Create directory: `mkdir -p coverage_reports`
3. Run tracker: `./scripts/track-coverage-history.sh coverage.out`

### CSV Parsing Issues

**Issue:** Trend report shows incorrect values

**Solution:**
1. Check CSV format: `head coverage_reports/coverage_history.csv`
2. Verify no special characters in commit hashes
3. Re-run tracker to generate fresh report
